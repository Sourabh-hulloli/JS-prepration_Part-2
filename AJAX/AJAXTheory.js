// BASIC THEORY

// AJAX : asynchronous javascript and XML

// is a set of "web development techniques"
// using many web technologies on the "client-side"
// to create asynchronous web applications.

// With AJAX, web applications can send and retrive
// data from a server asynchronously (in the background)
// without interfering with the display and behaviour of the existing page.

// We don't use data in XML format anymore.
// we use JSON now.

// we have 3 most common ways to create and send request to server
// 1. xmlHTTPRequest (old way of doing)
// 2. fetch API (new way of doing)
// 3. axios (this is third party library)
